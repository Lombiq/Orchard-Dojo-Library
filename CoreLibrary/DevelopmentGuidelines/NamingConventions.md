# Naming conventions

- Use the suffix “Base” for abstract classes.
- Suffix part classes) with "Part".
- Name js and css files with the segments of their names delimited by dashes, e.g. _my-style.css_.
- Resource names declared in resource manifests are also global so prefix them with the module's name e.g. "MyModule.MyStyle".
