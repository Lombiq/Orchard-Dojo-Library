# CSS best practices

Use a language that eases CSS development and compiles into CSS like [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) or [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). It's really worth trying! (And there's good tooling support.)

----------

When something is possible to style in a straightforward way without the usage of images by only using CSS (even e.g. by using font icons), then do it from CSS.

----------

Try to avoid HTML markup that serves just to enable some kind of styling.

----------

For HTML classes and IDs use dashed names e.g. `this-is-a-class`. In Orchard modules you may prefix these with the module name.
