# The InfosetPart content part

`InfosetPart` is one of Orchard's built-in [content part](ContentPart.md)s. It's always automatically attached to every content item of every content type. It represents (and provides access to) the so called infoset of the content item.

The infoset is a simple XML document that is stored along the content item in its `ContentItemRecord` or if [versioned](Versioning.md), in the `ContentItemVersionRecord`. It can store arbitrary data and is commonly used to save [content fields'](ContentField.md) data or data for content parts that needn't be queried. Since the `ContentItemRecord` and/or `ContentItemVersionRecord` is always loaded for a content item the infoset is also loaded at all times. Thus anything stored in the infoset can be retrieved quickly, without any subsequent database calls.

## Importance for content parts

If a content part needs to store data in the database one of the solutions would be to use a [content part record](ContentPartRecord.md). However such records, if not specifically set for eager-loading, are lazily loaded one by one when using the content item. To overcome this performance issue `InfosetPart` can be used to store the part's data, eliminating the need for further database queries.

However data stored in the `InfosetPart` can't be simply queried (i.e. filtered or ordered) using the database engine. By storing data both in the infoset and in the record, however, one can have the best of both worlds: querying is possible using the records but for any other database interaction the records are not loaded.

Orchard contains helper methods to ease the usage of the infoset.
