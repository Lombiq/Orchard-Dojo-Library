# Tokens

Tokens are pieces of codified text that are be dynamically substituted with other values. E.g. if you want to create a template for an e-mail that should be sent to users but you want to greet the users by their name you can use tokens to send a personalized text like this: "Dear {User.Name}!"

More information about tokens is [in the documentation](https://docs.orchardproject.net/en/latest/Documentation/Builtin-Features/#orchardtokens-off-by-default).
