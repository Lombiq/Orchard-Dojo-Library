# Content handler

Content handlers, or more specifically content part handlers are similiar to event handlers in programming in general: these methods' job is to handle specific events of a content part, e.g. when it's instantiated, deleted or versioned.

You can find a complete list of such events on the "[Understanding content handlers](http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Understanding-content-handlers)" page of the official documentation.
