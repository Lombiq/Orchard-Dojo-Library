# Content Manager service

The Content Manager is the important service in Orchard that you can use to interact with [content items](ContentItem) from code.

When developing a module you can use the Content Manager to create, update, retrieve and remove ([soft delete](Versioning)) content items, fetch different [versions](Versioning) of the same content item as well as import/export items, fetch items' metadata or build display and editor shapes. You can find a detailed example of how to use the Content Manager in the [Training Demo module](https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Training-Demo-Module/blob/dev-orchard-1/Controllers/ContentsAdminController.cs).
