# Content part driver

[Drivers](http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Basic-Orchard-Concepts#Driver) (more precisely: content part drivers) are pieces of code used in conjunction with [content parts](ContentPart). They are responsible for building the editor and display as well as handling importing and exporting of a content part.

Note that the same part can have multiple drivers.
