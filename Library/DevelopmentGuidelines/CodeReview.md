# Code review guidelines

Doing static code reviews is a great way to improve code quality and share knowledge in a team.

- Read [this study](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/11-proven-practices-for-peer-review/) about code reviews at Cisco; lot of good tips there. Also, [this article](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1156196/Code-Review-Checklist) is an ideal and simple checklist that can be used for code review.
- It's best to use a tool for code review where you can give comment for specific lines in the code. [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) both offer code line commenting for commits and pull requests. On Bitbucket you can "approve" commits and you can use this feauture during code reviews: when you reviewed a commit and found everything all right, then just approve it; otherwise, make comments on the code lines or the whole commit. Then later when all of your comments were addressed, you can approve that commit too. This way approval marks always show which commits shouldn't be dealt with any more.
- When doing code review, not just look at the code lines but also try to understand the whole component you review pieces of. This way you can also give you opinion about higher-level architectural decisions.
- Pay attention to pinpoint all kinds of issues: e.g. architectural, logical, styling, maintainability issues all count.
- Don't just look at what's there but also think about what's missing (e.g. validation, error handling, access control...).
- If you see repeated issues with the code (e.g. the same mistake repeated all over the code base) then don't add the same comment multiple times. Either reference the other locations in a single comment (e.g. "This is also repeated in the other controllers here.") or if you're reviewing a bigger piece of code then collect such issues in a shared document (or a comment for the whole codebase if you tool allows it) and just reference them (e.g. "See CodeReview.docx #3").
- During the core review you can find issues of high importance, such as critical security problems. Apart from adding these to the affected piece of code also separately collect them to make them apparent.
- Some tips on using Bitbucket for code reviews:
  - When reviewing individual commits that are not part of a pull request then mark every reviewed commit as Approved. Alternatively if you found issues with it comment on it. So a commit should be either Approved or have commits.
  - Once every comment of yours was addressed you can mark a commit as Approved too; this way you'll see which commit needs your attention.
  - When reviewing a pull request you can review the whole delta instead of individual commits. Most of the time it's better to review the whole delta.
  - When a pull request is done, set it as Approved and also merge it into the upstream branch. You can do this from Bitbucket too; then make sure to make Bitbucket also close the branch with the merge.
