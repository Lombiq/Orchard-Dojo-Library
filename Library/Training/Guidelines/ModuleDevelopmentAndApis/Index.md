# Module development and Orchard APIs (training topic)

The below topics are the core of what an Orchard developer should know. Other, less important items are listed under [Extended APIs](../ExtendedApis/).

- [Getting started with module development](GettingStartedWithModuleDevelopment)
- [Basic techniques in module development](BasicTechniquesInModuleDevelopment)
- [Developing custom content](DevelopingCustomContent)
- [Intermediate techniques in module development](IntermediateTechniquesInModuleDevelopment)
- [Advanced techniques in module development](AdvancedTechniquesInModuleDevelopment)
- [Complementary topics of module development](ComplementaryTopicsInModuleDevelopment)

## Addendum

Most of this comes from [Sipke Schoorstra’s Orchard Harvest session](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH9mcodTX-U) content (APIs, content part development).

We've created a demo module for the purpose of teaching all the topics here with well explained examples. See the [Orchard Training Demo module](https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Training-Demo-Module).

The [Orchard Cheat Sheet](http://sebastienros.github.com/CheatSheet/) by Sébastien Ros is a great small API reference.
