The knowledge of the below APIs is not necessary for all developers as these are needed only for more special tasks.

- [Extended APIs I.](ExtendedApis1)
- [Extended APIs II.](ExtendedApis2)
- [Extended APIs III.](ExtendedApis3)

There is no need to go into details about all providers, evaluating a few provider types used in Projector and a Token provider is enough.
