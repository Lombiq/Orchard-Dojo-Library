# Orchard training guidelines

The following guidelines serve as a base for Orchard 1.x trainings (the [Orchard Dojo website](http://orcharddojo.net/training) is for Orchard Core only) and you're welcome to hold your own Orchard training using these guidelines.

## Training methodologies

For methodologies for various forms of Orchard training see [training methodologies](TrainingMethodologies.md).

## Prerequisites for the participants

- Mandatory: basic usage of Visual Studio, basic knowledge of C#, basic knowledge of client-side web development (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Strongly advised: basic understanding of ASP.NET MVC and LINQ
- Advised: understanding inversion of control containers and dependency injection, usage of Razor

## Technical requirements

The following tools are needed for an Orchard training:

- Lab computers or participants' computers:
  - Software listed under "Software to install" in "[Development environment advice](../../DevelopmentGuidelines/DevelopmentEnvironment.md)".
  - Administrative account to install other components if necessary and to avoid permission issues when running Orchard
- Trainer's PC having all of the above and connected to a projector for demonstrations
- A whiteboard or something similar

## Topics

The topics are each divided into individual modules. These modules can, but don't necessarily have dependency on each other.
